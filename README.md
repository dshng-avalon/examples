### Avalon Examples

Creation, distribution and testing of Avalon example projects.

These projects are used in the Getting Started guide, along with during continous integration for end-to-end tests. The repository contains functionality for generating projects per "recipe" under varying configurations.

#### Usage

Data in Avalon is partitioned into files on disk and documents in a database. Files are available as-is, whereas database documents are stored in a serialised form which requires uploading.

```bash
$ python import.py batman
```

The above command will import the `batman` example project into your database such that you may use it like any normal project.

#### Create a New Project

Projects are created by (1) creating and publishing assets and (2) exporting the corrseponding database.

Thing to keep in mind.

1. Avoid referencing absolute paths. Instead, utilise the `AVALON_PROJECTS` environment variable, referencing the global directory in which all of your projects are stored.

Once you have created a project you would like to distribute, we'll do an "export" of the contents within the database.

```bash
$ python export.py my_project
```

Congratulations, your project is now ready for distribution!

#### Procedural Projects

A project can be procedurally generated by automatically publishing application-files.

As opposed to merely exporting/importing a given (fixed) database, a procedural project takes into account your `.config.toml` file and publishes files according to the given `configuration`.

In a procedural project, application files are known as "resources" and reside within the `resources/` directory. Each project contains a `.recipe.json` detailing the process of generating a given project.

**Example**

Here is what a recipe might look like for a project called "batman".

```json
[
  {
    "message": "Modeling..",
    "session": {
      "app": "mayapy2016",
      "asset": "Bruce",
      "silo": "assets",
      "config": "studiocfg",
      "task": "modeling"
    },
    "resources": ["model_v001.ma", "model_v002.ma", "model_v003.ma"]
  },
  {
    "message": "Rigging..",
    "session": {
      "app": "mayapy2016",
      "asset": "Bruce",
      "silo": "assets",
      "config": "studiocfg",
      "task": "rigging"
    },
    "resources": ["rig_v003.ma", "rig_v006.ma"]
  },
  {
    "message": "Animating..",
    "session": {
      "app": "mayapy2016",
      "asset": "shot1",
      "silo": "film",
      "config": "studiocfg",
      "task": "animation"
    },
    "resources": [
      "anim_v002.ma",
      "anim_v006.ma",
      "anim_v012.ma",
      "anim_v034.ma"
    ]
  }
]
```

Each item in this list is known as a `job` and each `job` is run sequentially via `build.py`.

```bash
$ python build.py batman
# Modeling..
#  processing 'model_v001.ma'..
#  processing 'model_v002.ma'..
#  processing 'model_v003.ma'..
# Rigging..
#  processing 'rig_v003.ma'..
#  processing 'rig_v006.ma'..
# Animating..
#  processing 'anim_v002.ma'..
#  processing 'anim_v006.ma'..
#  processing 'anim_v012.ma'..
#  processing 'anim_v034.ma'..
```

In order to _create_ a procedural project, you'll first create your project as per usual, and then "lift" the contained files into a resource directory, such as `resources/my_project/my_file.ma".
